<pre>

JS TESTING WITH JASMINE
------------------------

rake jasmine - point the browser to http://localhost:8888/

sinonjs has been included for mocking / stubbing / spying as well as jasmine-jquery.

Sinatra Assetpack handles coffeescript compilation on the fly, and in production, takes care of minification / uglification of js and coffeescript into 2 discrete files - vendor.js and application.js
