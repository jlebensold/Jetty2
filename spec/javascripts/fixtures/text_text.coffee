Having attended to all preliminary details
and being financially strengthened by Mrs. Barney\'s
generous donation, We took the next step of print-
ing cards, inviting the friends and public for the
evening of January Sth, to come and listen to the
reading of the Statement, Constitution and By-Laws
prepared by the committee. Then We arranged and
printed a beautiful program interspersed with ad-
dresses, songs, piano solos, reeitations, etc.
"The night, fortunately, was clear and as blue
as the Persian turquoise and the many millions of
stars were shining in yon canopy of God and the
atmosphere was permeated With conviction in the
success of our educational cause. Nearly 300 splen-
did men and Women assembled in the great big
studio; the recently appointed American Minister
to Persia, Mr. Charles Russell, with his daughter,
Was there; the Representative of Persia Was present,
and reporters from all the Wasliington papers Were
also there. The exercises began at 8:30 and ended
at 11:30. The Statement, Constitution and By-
Laws were read and ofiicially adopted, and the ofii-
cers elected by Ia unanimous vote. The Whole
gathering of friends and visitors responded nobly
to the spirit of the movement and the music, the
songs, the address, and Mr. Hannen\'s poetry made
the people very happy and caused us to realize a
little the importance of that memorable and never-
to~be-forgotten night. 
"Next afternoon I gave a reception in honor of
the newly elected oflicers in the offices. of the So-
ciety and many people came. Many kinds of Per-
sian refreshments were served. 
few days later Mrs. Barney gave a reception
in her magnificent studio on behalf of the ofiicers
of P. A. E. S., in honor of Mr. Russell, the Amer-
ican Minister to Persia, and invited about 150
society people to meet him. It was a brilliant
affair."

the Revelation of and during the three
Weeks they gave the Message in eight homes, in ad-
dition to a public meeting at the Young Hotel,
Where about eighty persons were present and that

interested. "Te quote from a letter Written by one
of our Bahai sisters in Honolulu: "Mr. Remey and
Mr. Struven Were entertained, during their visit, in
the best of our homes, and many Words of praise
of them were spoken. The Whole atmosphere seemed
to breathe peace and joy and love. God has truly
been with them and We have been greatly blessed."

"early days" in Chicago. Through all change and
stress their faith has never been shaken, their love
never waned. There is a strength, a certainty, an
authority, an assurance in the Bahai Vv\'ord, which
gives satisfaction. It is exalted above all other
teachings to such a degree that, when once really
taste-cl, there is no appetite for any other thing.
VVeel<ly group meetings are held in Los Angeles,
Pasadena and Tropico, at the homes, respectively, of
Mrs. Phillips, Miss Hammond, and Mr. and Mrs.
i/Vinterburn. A general public meeting is held once
a month in a hall in the city, to which the friends
gather from their several localities Within a radius
of twenty miles. L-os Angeles is in the same latitude
as Acca, and We turn our hearts and faces directly
to the East, to the Center of the Covenant, the
shining Orb of guidance. Thus East and West are
united in love and praise, communion and service.
